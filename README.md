# PROJECT termintel

Intelligence, as in collected evidence about a subject.

I am interested in creating terminal applications because I prefer to
do my work in a terminal window.  For both Bash scripts and compiled
applications, I am investigating **terminfo**, **termios**, and other
interfaces for managing the terminal.

This project started as a place to learn and experiment with terminfo
and other terminal-related objectives.  It has evolved into something
that may be useful not only as a learning tool, but also as a library
to simplify the development of console-based programs.

This README file should grow as I establish a development direction.

## ARTIFACTS

This project previously had a README file discussing objectives and
discoveries.  You might enjoy looking at the [old README][Concepts.md].
