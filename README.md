# PROJECT TermEx(pert)

Expert help for the development of console applications.

This project started as a place to learn and experiment with terminfo
and other terminal-related objectives.  It has evolved into something
that may be useful not only as a learning tool, but also as a library
to simplify the development of console-based programs.

This README file should grow as I establish a development direction.

## ARTIFACTS

This project previously had a README file discussing objectives and
discoveries.  You might enjoy looking at the [old README][Concepts.md].
